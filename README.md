# Deep Learning Credit Card Default Predictor Model

In the project I:
* Used Keras & Tensorflow
* Reviewed relevant literature
* Used a systematic approach to algorithm selection
* Used accuracy metrics to inform decisions
* Explored a range of DL techniques
* Produced a report detailing the design process

The dataset used can be found in *CCD.xls*

I completed this project whilst undertaking the ECM2423 module at the University of Exeter - full PDF specification can be found in *specification.pdf*

The grade was determined based on the mark scheme detailed in the specification, giving weight to code quality, model quality and report quality

Grade - 100/100
